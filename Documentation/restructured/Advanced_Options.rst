Chats
-------

First, you visit the settings menu by selecting Chats. Then you need to tap the upper left. In this submenu you can activate the end-to-end-encryption (called OMEMO). Afterwards, you go back to the settings menu by clicking Settings.

Media
------

In the settings menu you have to select Media.In this submenu you can optimize the settings for file exchange. You should select **File sharing via HTTP** and set the **File download limit** to 4 MB. Now you can send files and upload them to your XMPP server (instead of sending them directly to your communication partner). Files which you receive will be downloaded automatically if their size is below 4 MB.

Experimental
------------

In the settings menu you have to select select Experimental. Here you can activate the Groupchat bookmark sync to be able to see your group chats on multiple devices. Additionally, I recommend to deactive the usage of public STUN servers. Most todays XMPP servers already provide a STUN-service.
